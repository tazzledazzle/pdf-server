# pdf-server
running pdfbox on node.js server

Right now I have a simple pass going. It can parse the text and output it
to the console. Soon I would like the ability to process the pdf and 
gain understanding of the pdf, or do some analytics about the entities contained
in the document. I would also like to categorize documents by what they are 
as well using KNN, and display graphs.


To run:
First, execute

```
node index.js
```

then, navigate to ```localhost:8000```.
- upload a pdf to the server
- output will be displayed to the console
